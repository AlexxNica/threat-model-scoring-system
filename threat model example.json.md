This is a silly example of a threat model for enemy attacks on a game character.

    |     |     | Crosses arms in front of body when attacked
    |     |     | Assumes fetal position when attacked
    |     | Counter-punch | Throws uppercut when punched at
    |     |     | Throws right hook when punched at
    |     | Teleport | Magically relocates five feet when attacked
    |     |     | Evades attacks completely
    | Criticize |     |    
Ghost | Make scary noises | Assume defensive posture | Wears earplugs
    |     |     | Assumes fetal position when attacked
    | Drop an anvil | Assume defensive posture | Crosses arms in front of body when attacked
